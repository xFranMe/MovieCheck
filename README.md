# MovieCheck

## What is MovieCheck?

MovieCheck is an Android app designed to manage the audiovisual preferences of the user. It allows you to check information about the most popular movies of the moment. In addition, you can mark those movies that you like the most as favorites and even list them as pending so you do not miss out on the most interesting titles. Not only that, but the members of MovieCheck community will also be able to interact with each other and exchange their opinions through the social section that can be found in the details of ech movie. There you can give your own rating of the film in question and post any comments about it.

## Scope

This app has been developed as a small project for a software engineering degree subject. Hence, it is meant to work only in local mode. This means that the app uses a local database that is NOT shared among all devices. It supports multiple users as long as the activity is performed on the same device.

## About documentation

Documentation and more info about this app's design and development can be found in [this repository's wiki](https://github.com/xFranMe/MovieCheck/wiki) (Spanish).
